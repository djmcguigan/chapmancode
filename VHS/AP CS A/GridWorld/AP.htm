<h2>AP Support Material</h2><hr/>
<p>As one of my responsibilities as member of the APCS development committee,
I maintain the list of corrections and suggested changes to the GridWorld
case study.  The preliminary version of the code and documentation can be found
<a href="http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/members/courses/teachers_corner/151155.html">at
AP Central</a>.  Additional corrections should be reported to Fran Trees at <a href="mailto:ftrees@drew.edu">ftrees@drew.edu</a>.</p>

<h3>Corrections</h3>

<p>The following corrections will be made to the final version of the documentation when it appears in Summer, 2007.  Page numbers refer to the page in the complete PDF document.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pages 11 and 21.  Change "instance variable" to "instance field."
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Suggested Changes</h3>

<p>The following changes have been suggested.  Since these are more significant,
they need to be discussed by the entire Development Committee when it next meets in March 2007.</p>

<ul>
<li>Publish the GridWorld document in Spanish instead of English, so students can prepare for two tests at the same time. <em>(This is just provided as a sample change and is not serious, I hope.)</em>
</li>
</ul>

<hr/>
<p>Corrections and suggested changes to the code are maintained by Cay Horstmann and
can be found at <a href="http://www.horstmann.com/gridworld/bugs.html">his WWW site</a>.</p>
